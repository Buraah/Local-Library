Learning about Python and the amazing projects you can build with it has been a very interesting journey for me.
As part of my learning process, I decided to go further by learning the Django framework. This respository houses my Django project.
It is a local library that allows you to do simple library runs, like borrowing a book, returning it and so on.
I'm carrying out this project with the help of the Mdn tutorial(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django).

This is a work in progress and I will keep updating as I go.
Once I am done, I will indicate here

Work In Progress...
